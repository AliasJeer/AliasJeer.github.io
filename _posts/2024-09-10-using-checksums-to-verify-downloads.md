## What are checksums?
A checksum is simply a way to verify information integrity using math and the data from the original source to compare. Reading through the original file and checking each character side by side with the copy or downloaded would be a lot of work, but checksums can help make this an easy process. 

**A checksum is a hashed value derived from the data within a file after being run through a cryptographic function**

What this means is that if you know the algortithm used and the checksum of the original file when run through that algorithm, you can make sure that your file is an exact match by running your file through the same function and seeing if the hashes match. Here's an example. When I went to download the Parrot ISO to install it on my computer, I was able to find the page with the checksum values listed:

Notice the "Check Hashes" button under the download? If you click on it, it opens up a list of different hash values for different algortihms and files. It's a bit overwhelming I know. Most of the time you will only get a couple of these, but this is a great example of the concept. 

All of these values are generated by running different download files through each of the algorithms shown. These include md5, sha1, and sha256 as well as others. To check your download, you can run the same algorithm on your downloaded file and compare the hash to the one listed on the source page. In this case they match so I know the file I downloaded is the same as the hosted file.

## What checksums are not
One important thing to note is that while checksums are a great way to verify file integrity, they aren't actually meant for security per se. The true purpose is more to identify a corrupted download before running or opening it. As with most things in cybersecurity, a sufficiently motivated bad-actor can almost always find a way to circumvent any defense. A malicious actor could theoretically create an exploit file that had the same hashed value as the original. This would be extremely difficult and gets even more challenging with stronger algorithms, but it is something to note.

Having said that, comparing checksums is still a good check to verify a download hasn't been overtly compromised.  The goal here is to remove as many of those opportunities as possible. I hope to continue to grow my knowledge of cryptography as I continue on my journey.
